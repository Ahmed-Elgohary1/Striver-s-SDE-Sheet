### APPROACH

*First traverse all diagonals that start from left side.*

    - Diagonals with first element as mat[ 0 ] [ j ]

*Then traverse diaonals that start from the top.*

    - Diagonals with first element as mat[ i ] [ 0 ]

*Sort the elements by any means that seems best and then replace those elements.*
